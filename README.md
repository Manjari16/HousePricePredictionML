Here, I'll be posting all the small projects of Machine Learning done on Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook

HousePricePredictionML: This project is inspired by codebasics Datascience Project: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu7clOTtwsp94PcHbzqpAdg
It was done on Google colab. The model predicts the price of a house using Linear Regression, based on predictors like its area in square feet, location, number of bedrooms, etc.
