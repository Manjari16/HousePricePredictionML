Here, I'll be posting all the small projects of Machine Learning done on Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook

[HousePricePredictionML](HousePricePredictionML.ipynb): This project is inspired by [codebasics Datascience Project](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu7clOTtwsp94PcHbzqpAdg): It was done on Google colab. The model predicts the price of a house using Linear Regression, based on predictors like its area in square feet, location, number of bedrooms, etc.

[App Rating Prediction Model ](AppPredictionModel.ipynb): This project uses GridSearchCV to train the Regression model to predict the rating of app based on features like size, installs, sentiments, etc.  The dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps)
